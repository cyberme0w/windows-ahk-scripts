# cyberme0w's AutoHotkey Scripts
This repo is a collection of all AHK scripts I like to have whenever using Windows.
They mainly deal with Windows' rubbish default shortcuts and poor workspace management.

# Usage
As with any script you find on the internet, make sure to at least briefly read over it, to make sure I'm not installing any shady stuff on your system!
With this said, if you would like to try these out, you will need [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.
Once AutoHotkey is installed, clone this repository and just execute the `.ahk` files.
If you like them and would like to automatically load the changes at startup, use `ahk2exe` - AutoHotkey's `exe` generator - to make executables of these scripts,
and add them to the `Startup` folder (`Win+r` to open the `Run` prompt, then enter `shell:startup` to open the folder in explorer).
